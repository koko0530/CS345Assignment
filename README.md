# CS345Assignment

1.	The colors for each element were separately defined in the CSS file rather than using custom-color class, because I’ve defined many separate sections, and this is an easier way to manage when customizing each element.
2.	The sources for img and texts were referenced as comments in the html source code.
3.	The contents in “DONATE” section were designed to be on a separate page, so there was no direct access to that section in the home page.
4.	The paragraphs in “EXPLORE” section were copied from Wikipedia, and the source page have been referenced in the comments. Other texts were original.
